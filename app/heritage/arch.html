            <h2>The Shell Window</h2>
            <p>In theory an influence of the Neo-Manueline Architecture, the shell window is one of the key elements defining the Indo-Portuguese Architectural heritage of Goa.</p>

            <h2>Vibrant Colours</h2>
            <p>Here is yet another story that explains the vibrant coloured houses. During the colonial times, churches and chapels which sprung up in and around the settlements were painted white as a symbol of holiness and purity. To make them stand out distinctly from the rest of the buildings, the Portuguese insisted on painting them with bright and vibrant colours.</p>

            <h2>High Ceilings</h2>
            <p>A feature of the Neo-Gothic design, high ceilings with huge open spaces is predominantly seen in the churches built by the Portuguese. This design has also seeped into the architecture of the mansion houses built during the early 18th century by the wealthy Goan families.</p>

            <h2>The Balcao</h2>
            <p>The Shady front pillared porches is another key element of the Indo-Portuguese Architecture. Although the design roots can be traced back to pre-Portuguese times, the The emphasis upon the decorative style and the ornate is surely an influence of the neo-classic and gothic designs. An incorporation of the same is also seen in the design of the wrought iron balconies hanging on the heritage houses.</p>
